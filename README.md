## Overview

The Compare Model Evaluation Reports app is an application that allows you to compare the evaluation reports of two or more models side by side. This app is useful for comparing the performance of different models on the same dataset and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each model. The app generates a report that displays the evaluation metrics for each model, making it easy to compare the results and identify the best-performing model.

## Preparation

Before running the app, make sure you have the following:

- Evaluation reports for the models you want to compare. You can use the [Model Evaluation](https://ecosystem.supervisely.com/apps/model-benchmark) app to generate the reports for each model.
- Evaluation reports are generated on the same dataset.
- Evaluation reports are generated in the same task type.
- Evaluation reports are generated using the same classes.

## How To Run

**Step 1:** Open the app from the Supervisely Ecosystem.

**Step 2:** Select from the Team Files the evaluation reports for the models you want to compare.

**Step 3:** Click the `Run` button.
